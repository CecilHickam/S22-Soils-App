# Soil and Aquatic Data Visualization Project
Final Capstone Project from spring 2022 Virginia Tech Environmental Data Science
App was created for a scientist doing research in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest and needed more insight and data visualization with what she had collected. 

Myself and three others created this using the Shiny package in R, using knowledge and skills we have gained from our college career.




***APP FUNCTIONALITY***


This app visualizes terrestrial and aqautic data collected from the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest through reactive visualizations. Users can manipulate the data using various interactive elements found in both tabs.
Information about the functionality and parts of this app are below:
Timeseries Analysis
Up to four graphs can be created based on the users desired variable of analysis and date range. All plots are reactive with the ability to change the variable and date.
Bivariate Analysis
Up to four graphs can be created based on the users desired variables of analysis. All plots are reactive with the ability to change the variables.
